We analyse large and complex biological data sets generated by researchers at the Crick and act in an advisory role for researchers who want to perform their own analysis.

We have an extensive range of expertise in data science, data visualisation, data storage, computer programming, web development, statistics, experiment design, genomics and molecular biology.

Due to technological advances, many labs at the Crick need to store, process, analyse and share enormous data sets, of a size previously found only in fields such as astronomy and particle physics.

Not only are these data sets increasing in size and in number, theyâ€™re also varied and highly complex. As bioinformaticians, a large part of our job is to try and keep up with this explosion in biological Big Data.
